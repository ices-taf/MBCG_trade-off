This interactive document presents information on the distribution, intensity, impact, landings weight, and landings value of mobile bottom-contacting gear (MBCG) fisheries within the ECOREG area and the estimated consequences and costs (expressed as loss of landings weight and value) of reducing the relative extent of areas fished with MBCG. The information is from an assessment for the ECOREG area for the period 2017â€’2022. The six-year period was selected to include the latest available vessel monitoring system (VMS) and logbook data rather than to match a specific Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) assessment period (EU, 2008). The assessment describes fishing intensity and impact with five pressure indicators and four benthic impact indicators (Table E1).
