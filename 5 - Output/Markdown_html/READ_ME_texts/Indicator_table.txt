Indicator code	Indicator name	Indicator type	Description	Spatial scale	Period
I‒1	Average fishing intensity	Pressure	Average number of times a defined area is swept by mobile bottom-contacting gears (MBCG). Estimated as the sum of swept area for all vessels using MBCG divided by the total area of the defined area	Absolute extent (km^2^)	One year
I‒2	Proportion of area fished, \nevaluated at c-square scale	Pressure	The sum of the area of c-squares fished at least once by MBCG in a defined area, divided by the sum of the area of all c squares in the defined area	C-square	One year
I‒3	Proportion of area fished	Pressure	The sum of MBCG swept area in all c-squares in a defined area (where any swept area > c square area is set to c-square area), divided by the sum of the area of all c-squares in the defined area	Absolute extent (km^2^)	One year
I‒4	Smallest proportion of area with 90% of fishing intensity, \nevaluated at c-square scale	Pressure	The sum of the area of the smallest set of c squares accounting for 90% of the total MBCG swept area in a defined area, divided by the sum of the area of all c-squares in the defined area	C-square	One year
I‒5	Proportion of area persistently unfished, \nevaluated at c-square scale	Pressure	The sum of the area of c-squares not fished with MBCG at any time in the assessment period in a defined area, divided by the sum of the area of all c-squares in the defined area	C-square	Six years (assessment period)
I‒6a	Average PD impact	Impact	The annual mean PD impact (population dynamics method, impact indicator), evaluated for a defined area	C-square	One year
I‒6b	Average PD-sens impact	Impact	The annual mean PD-sens impact (population dynamics method, impact indicator for sensitive species), evaluated for a defined area	C-square	One year
I‒7a	Proportion of area with PD impact < 0.2, \nevaluated at c-square scale	Impact	The sum of the area of c-squares in a defined area with PD < 0.2 divided by the sum of the area of all c-squares in the defined area (values <0.2 define areas where predicted reductions in abundance of benthic fauna are <20%. The threshold of 0.2 is illustrative only)	C-square	One year
I‒7b	Proportion of area with PD-sens impact < 0.2, \nevaluated at c-square scale	Impact	The sum of the area of c-squares in a defined area with PD-sens < 0.2 divided by the sum of the area of all c-squares in the defined area (values <0.2 define areas where predicted reductions in abundance of benthic fauna are <20%. The threshold of 0.2 is illustrative only)	C-square	One year
