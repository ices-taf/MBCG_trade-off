Five pressure indicators were used to describe fishing intensity and distribution resulting from the use of MBCG (Table E1). 

These indicators are calculated, for any given area as defined in this document, from estimates of the swept area in each of the c-squares within a defined area of interest. The swept area is calculated as hours fished × average fishing speed × gear width. This requires that VMS location records are linked to logbook data to associate a location and speed with gear code and fishing activity (Data Collection Framework level 4 and 6 respectively). VMS locations are allocated to “fishing” and “not fishing” based on vessel speed and other filters (ICES, 2022). The gear width is estimated based on relationships between average gear widths and average vessel length or engine power (kW; Eigaard et al. 2016; ICES, 2022). The swept-area ratio (SAR) is calculated as the sum of the area swept by a defined set of MBCG in a defined area (usually one c-square) in a defined period (usually one year) divided by the area of the defined area. Therefore, when calculated at the c-square scale, the SAR indicates the theoretical number of times the c-square is swept per year, assuming that the MBCG fishing is evenly distributed over the c-square. For example, a SAR of 2 means that the entire c-square is fished two times over the year, a SAR of 0.5 means that the entire c-square is fished once in two years.
