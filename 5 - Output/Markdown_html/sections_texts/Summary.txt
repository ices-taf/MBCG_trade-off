**Geographic scope:** 
The assessment in this interactive document covers EU waters of depths shallower than 800 m in the MSFD subdivisions associated with the ECOREG area. EU waters are the waters defined by EU Member States, in this area, for MSFD implementation purposes (Figure E1). 


**Spatial scales of analyses:** 
Analyses are presented by MSFD subdivision, MSFD broad habitat type (BHT) and for depth strata 0‒200 m, 200‒400 m, and 400‒800 m. The 0.05° × 0.05° c-squares (hereafter c-squares) were allocated to subdivisions based on centroid positions. Mean depths in c-squares were used to allocate c-squares to depth strata. For the Baltic Sea area, the subdivisions are as used in the ICES 2021 advice (ICES, 2021) and based on the HELCOM sub-basins (HELCOM, 2013). For the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast areas, the subdivisions used are the OSPAR benthic habitat assessment area units (OSPAR, 2022), as used in the OSPAR 2023 Quality Status Report (OSPAR, 2023). The extent of BHTs, as defined under the MSFD, is determined per c-square.

Values of pressure indicators (I‒1 to I‒5) and impact indicators (I‒6a, I‒6b, I‒7a, and I‒7b) by depth strata (Table 1) provide information on the distribution, intensity, and impact of MBCG fisheries. The indicators are described in the “Essential information” tab in this document.

For depths of 0‒200 m, T1I3DC1 of the area is fished with MBCG per year (I‒3). However, 90% of the total MBCG swept area is concentrated in an annual average of T1I4DC1 of the ECOREG area. T1I5DC1 of the area at these depths was not fished with MBCG at all from 2017‒2022, based on the data submissions received. 
For depths of 0‒200m, MBCG fishing was estimated to reduce the total biomass of benthic fauna by T1I6aDC1 (I‒6a) and reduce the total biomass of sensitive fauna by T1I6bDC1 (I‒6b). Within this depth strata, the depletion of benthic fauna was less than 20% in T1I7aDC1 (I‒7a) of the area. For sensitive fauna the corresponding area was T1I7bDC1 (I‒7b). 
The heterogeneous distributions of annual mean fishing intensity (swept area ratio [SAR]), annual mean total landings values (euros) and weight (kg), and seabed sensitivity (as estimated median longevity of the benthic fauna), are illustrated in Figure 1. The distributions of the fishing intensity and the seabed sensitivity account for the values of pressure and impact indicators reported in Table 1. 

Small-scale fisheries, defined as vessels < 12 m in overall length deploying MBCG, operate in the ECOREG area as well. As these are not required to carry VMS by the EU Control Regulation (EU, 2009), their coverage in the VMS data submissions is unknown. The EU Fisheries Dependent Information (FDI) data does report on small-scale fisheries effort in kW × fishing days. However, the FDI reporting units differ from the subdivisions, BHTs, and depth strata used in these analyses. The correspondence between subdivisions and FDI reporting regions is illustrated in Figure E1. The incomplete data for small-scale fisheries results in underestimates of fishing intensity and impact, especially in inshore areas. In the ECOREG area the proportion of the total kW × fishing days of MBCG fishing attributed to small-scale fisheries (Table 2) varies from T2SSFrange between FAO regions.
