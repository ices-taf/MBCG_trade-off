The fishing footprint reduction scenarios illustrate the effects of stepwise MBCG fisheries exclusion from specified proportions of each broad habitat type within the ECOREG area. The stepwise exclusion is conducted in 10% increments, ranging from 10% to 90%. In each successive increment, the c-squares containing the least MBCG swept area are excluded. The resulting reduction in swept area (Table 6), landings weight (Table 7), and landings value (Table 8) is presented for the prevailing broad habitat types combined and for each type separately. 

For example, the analysis shows that the exclusion of MBCG from 30% of all prevailing broad habitat types is affecting T630pctALL of the footprint (Table 6), T730pctALL of the landings weight (Table 7) and T830pctALL of the landings value (Table 8). In this example, the pattern reflects the extent to which MBCG fishing activity is concentrated in core areas, with relatively effort and landings in peripheral areas.
