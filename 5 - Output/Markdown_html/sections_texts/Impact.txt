Fishing impact, as assessed with the PD indicator (I−6a) and the PD-sens indicator (I−6b), results from the fishing intensity for MBCG métiers and the median longevity of the benthic fauna (Figure 1) as well as métier-specific depletion rates per trawl pass (Table 5 in the main advice document). The PD-sens indicator only considers sensitive fauna and shows greater impacts than the PD indicator (Figures 5 and 6). 

The spatial distribution of the fishing impact in the ECOREG area is shown in Figure 5. When based on the PD indicator, fishing impact is PDav on average (I−6a), with PDpct of the area having a fishing impact below 0.2 (I−7a; Figure 6). For the PD-sens indicator, the average impact is PDSav (I−6b), with PDSpct of the area having less impact than 0.2 (I−7b; Figure 6).

For the T4maxSAmet métier, which accounts for the largest proportion of swept area (Table 4), landing weight is T5landPDkg tonnes and landings value T5landPDval euro per unit of PD impact. Similarly, landing weight is T5landPDskg tonnes and landings value T5landPDsval per unit of PD-sens impact (Table 5). The métier with the highest landings weight per unit impact is T5maxPDkgmet (T5maxPDKG), and the métier with the highest landings value per unit impact is the T5maxPDvalmet T5maxPDVAL. 

Métier-related impacts, as measured with the PD and PD-sens indicators, vary among BHTs because of variations in fishing intensity, seabed sensitivity (Figure 1), and the depletion rate of the specific métier (Table 5 in the main advice document; Figure 7). The largest PD and PD sens impacts in the ECOREG area are attributed to the maximpmetPD métier fishing on maximpvalPD.
