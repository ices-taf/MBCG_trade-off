The extent and relative abundance of broad habitat types in the ECOREG area are presented in Table 3. This table also presents landings weight and landings value and the intensity of MBCG fisheries operating in these habitats. Note that fishing data is only available at the c-square level and is assumed to be uniformly distributed over all habitat types present in that c-square. Each habitat type present is proportionally assigned the fishing data registered in that c-square. 

The most extensive habitat type is T3mainBHT occupying T3BHT1ext. The average fishing intensity (swept area ratio) on this habitat is T3BHT1I1, covering annually on average T3BHT1I3 of the habitat extent. 90% of the fishing effort in this broad habitat type, however, is concentrated to T3BHT1I4 of the habitat extent. T3BHT1I5 of this habitat is located in c-squares that are persistently not fished. The largest landing (in tonnes) is derived from fishing on T3BHTmaxkg and the greatest landings values come from fishing on T3BHTmaxval.

Temporal variation of the pressure indicators I-1, I-3, and I-4 are shown in Figure 2 for the ECOREG area.
