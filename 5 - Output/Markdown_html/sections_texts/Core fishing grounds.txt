Core fishing grounds are defined as the smallest area yielding 90% of the landings value, evaluated annually at the c-square scale. The spatial stability of core fishing grounds over the assessment period 2017-2022 is described as the number of years a c-square is identified as a core fishing ground. This spatial extent and stability of the core fishing grounds varies among métiers (Figures 3, 4). 

Métier CFGmaxpctCFG has CFGmaxCFGpct of the ECOREG area identified at least once as a core fishing ground. For métier CFGminpctCFG, this extent is much smaller (CFGminCFGpct). The most stable core fishing grounds (highest fraction of core fishing ground c-squares identified as core fishing ground in all 6 years) are observed for CFGmaxCFGmet, whereas the métier CFGminCFGmet shows the least stable core fishing grounds in the ECOREG area. 

Overall, there is considerable variation in the stability of core fishing grounds among métiers. This is expected to be a consequence of inter-annual movements of fishing locations, due to the habitat affinity of the variety of fish and shellfish targeted by different métiers (Table 5, main advice document) and the effects of economic and regulatory factors.
